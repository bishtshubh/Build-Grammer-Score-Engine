# Build grammer score engine

# A full-stack web application that allows users to upload audio files, automatically transcribe speech to text, analyze grammar, highlight mistakes, and generate a grammar score.


# The solution was built incrementally by separating concerns between frontend and backend. Audio processing, transcription, and grammar analysis were modularized to ensure scalability and maintainability. Each stage was validated independently with error handling to ensure reliability and a smooth user experience.
